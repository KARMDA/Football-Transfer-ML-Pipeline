AI Transfer IQ is a deep learning project that predicts football player market values using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. It leverages player performance data, injury history, and physical attributes to estimate transfer value accurately. The model is trained on historical datasets, uses feature scaling, and outputs predictions with metrics like RMSE, MAE, R², and MAPE. This system helps clubs and scouts make data-driven decisions in player transfers and valuations.
